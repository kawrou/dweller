# dweller
A re-implementation of the MakersBnB project in Django

Dweller is a Django-based property booking web application inspired by platforms like Airbnb. It serves as a portfolio project that demonstrates the creation of a modular, full-stack application using Django, HTMX, and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

Dweller allows property owners to create listings and users to browse and book properties. The project is designed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with room for future enhancements. It features:

- User authentication (registration, login, logout)
- Property listing management (create, view, and filter listings)
- Basic booking functionality 
- Dynamic UI updates with HTMX

## Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  Secure user registration, login, and session management using Django's built-in auth system.

- **Property Listings:**  
  Property owners can add listings with details like title, description, price, location, and images. Listings are displayed on a dynamic home page.

- **Booking Functionality:**  
  Users can book properties for available dates. The booking model uses PostgreSQLâ€™s native `DateRangeField` for handling date ranges.

- **Dynamic Content with HTMX:**  
  The homepage includes category filters that use HTMX to asynchronously update the property grid without a full page reload.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Frontend Enhancements:** HTMX
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Environment Management:** pipenv
